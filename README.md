# Nudibranchs of Southwest Australia field guide

This repo builds a website that acts as a field guide for nudibranchs (and allied/confused species) in Western Australia, including both endemic and invasive species.

Each species has links to the [World Register of Marine Species](https://www.marinespecies.org/), the [Encyclopedia of Life](https://eol.org/), and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) (where available). These sites contain more photos and details of each species to assist with identification.

I welcome [contributions](contributing.md), but the system for doing so is not very use friendly at the moment.
