I welcome contributions but have not yet worked out the best way to accept them.

## Code of Conduct

By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](/coc). If you do not want to abide by the Code of Conduct, you do not need to contribute.

## New species and observations

This website uses a data model based on [Darwin Core Simple](https://dwc.tdwg.org/simple/) metadata.

If you are familiar with GitHub, I would very much appreciate an [Issue](https://github.com/mpfl/nudis/issues) or a [Pull Request](https://github.com/mpfl/nudis/pulls), using an existing [observation](https://github.com/mpfl/nudis/tree/main/_observations) or [species](https://github.com/mpfl/nudis/tree/main/_species) file as a template.

If you are not familiar with GitHub, that's okay. You can use the [Discussions](https://github.com/mpfl/nudis/discussions) in the code repository to make any suggestions. You will need to [create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) before you can start a discussion.

If you're a data nerd like I am, you might like to familiarise yourself with the [data model](https://github.com/mpfl/nudis/blob/main/design/data-model.md).

You will need to grant me a licence to use your photo or I cannot legally do so. My preferred method is for you to apply a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) to the photo. You will always be credited for the creation of the photo.

## General website improvements

I am not a web designer or UX expert. I have hacked together something using Jekyll, JQuery, and Bootstrap. If you have any suggestions for improvement, I would very much appreciate an [Issue](https://github.com/mpfl/nudis/issues) or a [Pull Request](https://github.com/mpfl/nudis/pulls).
